Eventually, I noticed <code>PPVIN_S0_CPUVR_VIN</code> missing and found <code>R7202</code> was disconnected from <code>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</code>. Fixed by wiring it to <code>C7316</code> (unpopulated), which was still connected to the rail.</p><p>Thank you <a href="https://dosdude1.com/" target="_blank">dosdude1</a> for tips. This was very confusing for me.</p><h3>MacBook Air 11" 2014 (820-3435, "mc 1")</h3><p>It only worked in SMC bypass mode, because <code>PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC</code> was shorted to ground. The cause was <code>C5125</code>; removing it let the laptop turn on normally.</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.badcaps.net/forum/troubleshooting-hardware-devices-and-electronics-theory/troubleshooting-laptops-tablets-and-mobile-devices/109153-macbook-air-13-a1466-820-3437-b-and-00165-a" target="_blank">this post</a>.</p><h3>MacBook Air 11" 2015 (820-00164, "mc 4")</h3><p>This laptop's <code>PPBUS_G3H</code> was shorted. Injecting 5 V caused <code>C7431</code> to smoke, and removing it cleared the short.</p><p>It still didn't turn on, because <code>F7140</code> was burned (I don't <i>think</i> by me; it's upstream of <code>PPBUS_G3H</code>). Fixed by replacing with a wire.</p><h3>MacBook Air 11" 2015 (820-00164, "mc 6")</h3><p>No power or charger light, missing <code>PPBUS_G3H</code> but not shorted, <code>PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR</code> present but no <code>CHGR_PHASE</code>. This meant <code>Q7130</code> wasn't turned on (<code>CHGR_LGATE</code>) by <code>U7100</code>, which finally clued me in to <code>PP3V42_G3H</code> being shorted.</p><p>Injecting 3.3 V caused <code>C5002</code> to heat up; removing it fixed the laptop.</p><h3>MacBook Pro 13" 2015 (820-4924)</h3><p>Powered on inconsistently, no force touch feedback (touchpad worked otherwise), <code>PPVIN_S4_TPAD_FUSE</code> shorted (but <code>F4800</code> intact). The short and unreliability went away with the touchpad disconnected.</p><p>Found a visibly burnt capacitor on the underside of the touchpad board (bottom-right <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Retina+Display+Early+2015+Teardown/38300#s86966" target="_blank">here</a>; I don't have a schematic). Fixed by crushing it with pliers, oops.</p><h3>iPhone 4S</h3><p>It turned on, but restores failed with "error 29" and <code>update_gas_gauge</code> messages in logs. Found that <code>R61</code>/<code>BATTERY_SWI</code> lacked continuity to the corresponding pin on the battery connector. Soldering a wire resolved this.</p><p>Also (accidentally) learned that disconnecting <code>R153</code>/<code>BATTERY_NTC</code> blocks charging but <i>doesn't</i> affect booting or restores; I re-soldered it after.</p><h3>MacBook 12" 2016 (820-00244, "uc 1")</h3><p>It intermittently acted like the power button was held down. <code>SMC_ONOFF_L</code> was around 1.5 V (expected 3.3 V) and 8 KΩ to <code>SMC_LSOC_RST</code> (expected no connection).</p><p>Resolved by cleaning corrosion on the touchpad board.</p><h3>MacBook Pro 15" 2015 (820-00163, "gc 2")</h3><p>It didn't work due to a short on <code>PP3V3_S5</code>, which was cleared by removing <code>C3380</code>.</p><h3>MacBook Pro 15" 2015 (820-00163, "gc 1")</h3><p>This had suffered liquid damage to the display assembly; it still showed an image, but the backlight didn't work. Neither a known-good board nor screen helped.</p><p>The logic board's <code>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</code> wasn't connected to the little <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Retina+Display+Mid+2012+LCD+Cable+Replacement/144190#s292092" target="_blank">display board</a>, because the eDP cable's pin #1 was completely missing on the LCD side. Swapping the cable restored continuity, but now it was shorted to ground. I found burned debris inside the eDP socket; replacing it fixed the short.</p><p>The original board still didn't work, with <code>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</code> only around 12 V. <code>LCD_BKLT_EN</code> and the I2C lines seemed correct, but <code>U7701</code> wasn't pulling <code>BKLT_SD</code>/<code>LCDBKLT_EN_L</code> low, so <code>Q7706</code> wasn't on. I don't know why; the traces and resistors were okay; <a href="https://dosdude1.com/" target="_blank">dosdude1</a> said <code>U7701</code> itself was probably damaged.</p><p>I worked around this by wiring <code>BKLT_SD</code> (at <code>R7702</code>) to ground. The backlight turns on (and off) as expected now, but it's definitely a hack...</p><h3>MacBook Air 13" 2015 (820-00165, "chloe 9")</h3><p>No power, but the charger light worked, and the fan clicked periodically in SMC bypass mode. S5 rails were stable, S4 - S0 pulsed at around 4 second intervals. It turned out that <code>SPI_CS0_L</code> was broken somewhere between <code>R6110</code> and the test point by <code>U6100</code>, preventing reading the firmware.</p><p>Fixed by soldering a wire.</p></div></body></html>

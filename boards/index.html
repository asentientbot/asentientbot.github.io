Eventually, I noticed <code>PPVIN_S0_CPUVR_VIN</code> missing and found <code>R7202</code> was disconnected from <code>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</code>.</p><p>Fixed by wiring <code>R7202</code> to <code>C7316</code> (unpopulated), which had continuity to that rail.</p><p>Thank you <a href="https://dosdude1.com/" target="_blank">dosdude1</a> for tips. This was very confusing for me.</p><h3>MacBook Air 11" 2014 (820-3435, "mc 1")</h3><p>It only worked in SMC bypass mode because <code>PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC</code> was shorted to ground. The cause was <code>C5125</code>; removing it let the laptop turn on normally.</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.badcaps.net/forum/troubleshooting-hardware-devices-and-electronics-theory/troubleshooting-laptops-tablets-and-mobile-devices/109153-macbook-air-13-a1466-820-3437-b-and-00165-a" target="_blank">this post</a>.</p><h3>MacBook Air 11" 2015 (820-00164, "mc 4")</h3><p>This (disgustingly dirty) laptop's <code>PPBUS_G3H</code> was shorted. Injecting 5 V caused <code>C7431</code> (on <code>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</code>) to smoke, and removing it cleared the short on both rails.</p><p>It still didn't work, because <code>F7140</code> was burned (I don't <i>think</i> by me; it's upstream from <code>PPBUS_G3H</code>). Fixed by replacing with a wire.</p><h3>MacBook Air 11" 2015 (820-00164, "mc 6")</h3><p>No power or charger light, missing <code>PPBUS_G3H</code> but not shorted, <code>PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR</code> present but no <code>CHGR_PHASE</code>. This meant <code>Q7130</code> wasn't turned on (<code>CHGR_LGATE</code>) by <code>U7100</code>, which finally clued me in to <code>PP3V42_G3H</code> being shorted.</p><p>Injecting 3.3 V caused <code>C5002</code> to heat up; removing it fixed the laptop.</p></div></body></html>

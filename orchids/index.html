They're surprisingly easy to care for, and I love them very much.</p><p>I'll reorganize this page eventually; it's mainly just pretty photos for now.</p><h3>cattleya</h3><p>These grow as a series of vertical bulbs with leaves and beautiful ruffled flowers on top. I've duplicated mine by cutting between the stalks while repotting.</p><p><img src="/orchids/cattleya-green.jpg" alt="a pale green cattleya flower with a tiny bit of pink on the lip"></p><p><img src="/orchids/cattleya-red.jpg" alt="a deep red cattleya flower"></p><h3>brassavola (?)</h3><p>I'm not sure if this is a brassavola, brassocattleya, or something else. Interestingly, the petals fade from magenta to white over a few weeks. It grows much like the cattleyas and was easy to propagate as well.</p><p><img src="/orchids/brassavola-maybe.jpg" alt="a speckled light pink flower with very long petals and a tube with a circular lip in the middle"></p><h3>dendrobium</h3><p>Another sympodial orchid. Unlike the others, it forms cute baby plants (complete with roots!) midair. Mine has very pretty but short-lived flowers.</p><p><img src="/orchids/dendrobium.jpg" alt="about eight magenta dendrobium flowers on a stalk, with more buds developing at the end"></p><h3>phalaenopsis</h3><p>These have a central crown with flat leaves, long stems and a huge variety of flower patterns. I don't know how to duplicate them yet.</p><p><img src="/orchids/phalaenopsis-purple.jpg" alt="a handful of small purple phalaenopsis flowers with a mottled white texture at the edge"></p><p><img src="/orchids/phalaenopsis-white-and-pink.jpg" alt="a large phalaenopsis flower with white petals and a pink and orange lip; another bud is developing"></p><p><img src="/orchids/phalaenopsis-pink.jpg" alt="a large pink phalaenopsis flower, viewed from the back with light shining through"></p><p><img src="/orchids/phalaenopsis-white-big.jpg" alt="a large phalaenopsis flower with white petals and a speckled brownish-orange lip"></p><p><img src="/orchids/phalaenopsis-green-big.jpg" alt="a big yellowish-green phalaenopsis flower; the center has an orange texture"></p><p><img src="/orchids/phalaenopsis-green-small.jpg" alt="a handful of small pale green phalaenopsis flowers with orange lips and purple speckles near the middle"></p></div></body></html>

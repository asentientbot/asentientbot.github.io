They're surprisingly easy to care for, and I love them very much.</p><p>I'll reorganize this page eventually; it's mainly just pretty photos for now.</p><h3>cattleya</h3><p>These grow as a series of vertical bulbs topped with leaves and beautiful ruffled flowers. I've duplicated mine by cutting between the stalks while repotting.</p><p><img src="/orchids/cattleya-green.jpg" alt="a pale green cattleya flower with ruffled petals and a purple-tipped lip"></p><p><img src="/orchids/cattleya-red.jpg" alt="a deep red cattleya flower with ruffled petals"></p><p><img src="/orchids/cattleya-orange.jpg" alt="an orchid with long, smooth orange petals and a very cylindrical lip in the middle"></p><p><img src="/orchids/cattleya-maybe-white-and-pink.jpg" alt="a large white and pink flower; the petals stick out a lot and have fringed edges"></p><h3>brassavola (?)</h3><p>I'm not sure if this is a brassavola, brassocattleya, or cattleya. It grows much like the cattleyas and is similarly easy to propagate.</p><p><img src="/orchids/brassavola-maybe.jpg" alt="a speckled light pink flower with very long petals and a tube with a circular lip in the middle"></p><h3>dendrobium</h3><p>This sympodial orchid generates cute baby plants (with roots!) mid-air; they can be separated and grown on their own.</p><p><img src="/orchids/dendrobium.jpg" alt="about eight magenta dendrobium flowers on a stalk, with more buds developing at the end"></p><h3>phalaenopsis</h3><p>These have a central crown, flat leaves, and an endless variety of flower patterns. I don't know how to propagate monopodial orchids yet.</p><p><img src="/orchids/phalaenopsis-purple.jpg" alt="a handful of small purple phalaenopsis flowers with a mottled white texture at the edge"></p><p><img src="/orchids/phalaenopsis-white-and-pink.jpg" alt="a large phalaenopsis flower with white petals and a pink and orange lip; another bud is developing"></p><p><img src="/orchids/phalaenopsis-pink.jpg" alt="a large pink phalaenopsis flower, viewed from the back with light shining through"></p><p><img src="/orchids/phalaenopsis-white-big.jpg" alt="a large phalaenopsis flower with white petals and a speckled brownish-orange lip"></p><p><img src="/orchids/phalaenopsis-white-small.jpg" alt="a scattering of little white phalaenopsis flowers, viewed from behind"></p><p><img src="/orchids/phalaenopsis-green-big.jpg" alt="a big yellowish-green phalaenopsis flower; the center has an orange texture"></p><p><img src="/orchids/phalaenopsis-green-small.jpg" alt="a handful of small pale green phalaenopsis flowers with orange lips and purple speckles near the middle"></p><p><img src="/orchids/phalaenopsis-veined-light.jpg" alt="three phalaenopsis flowers with a pale yellow and pink veined pattern"></p><p><img src="/orchids/phalaenopsis-veined-dark.jpg" alt="a phalaenopsis flower with a dramatic yellow and purple veined pattern"></p></div></body></html>

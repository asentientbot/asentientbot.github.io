Much like Scratch 2 and Flash themselves, <b>this is completely obsolete</b>, but similar projects like <a href="https://sheeptester.github.io/htmlifier/" target="_blank">HTMLifier</a> are available for Scratch 3.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who sent encouraging feedback; as my first "real" coding project, it meant a lot to me.</p><h3>download</h3><p>The final version is <a href="/scratch/Scratch%20Converter%20v3.8.zip">here</a>, and the "Create Projector" workaround is <a href="/scratch/Projector%20Tools.zip">here</a>. Please don't look at the code, lol.</p><h3>license</h3><p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt" target="_blank">GPL v2</a>, as a derived work of <a href="https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-flash" target="_blank">Scratch 2</a>. I was also asked to include the following: <code>Scratch is developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. See http://scratch.mit.edu.</code></p></div></body></html>
